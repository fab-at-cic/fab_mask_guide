The Olson mask has emerged as one of the most highly regarded maker PPE designs due to its nearly universal fit, relative simplicity to make, reusability and potential for a high level of protection for the wearer. Designed by Clayton Skousen and Rose Hedges at Generate @ UnityPoint Health, a health tech fabrication lab in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the Olson mask was made by clinicians for clinicians. It’s designed to work as a simple procedural mask, a covering that prolongs the life of a respirator like the N95 masks, or even as a substitute for N95 masks when these aren’t available. This broad applicability makes it useful to almost everyone, from a hospital doctor to a frontline worker to anyone stepping outside their home.

Fab@CIC was drawn to work with the Olson design for these reasons, and because we realized that by cutting out the pieces of the pattern on a laser cutter, we could significantly speed up the process of community production of cloth masks and eliminate errors in cutting material by hand. In the weeks and months following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, networks of sewists have appeared to sew cloth masks at home to supply to their friends and family, health centers and nursing homes, and to social service organizations. Pre-cut patterns help save time and reduce burnout, thus helping sustain the energy in community-based mask production. This guide intends to provide the resources to any Fab Lab interested in sustaining sewists in their community or in undertaking the entire process.
