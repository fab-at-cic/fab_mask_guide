Even though the mask makers are wearing masks themselves and following safety procedures during production, there exists the chance of masks spreading infection to the recipients. To prevent this, we recommend that the institution receiving masks wash them as soon as they receive them. If this isnâ€™t possible for any reason, the fab lab could consider washing them in a warm washer / dryer cycle and placing the clean masks immediately into a ziploc bag for hand off.
