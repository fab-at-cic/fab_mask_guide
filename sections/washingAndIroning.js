Washing and ironing the cotton fabric is perhaps a surprisingly important part of the process and if done well will set you up for success with the subsequent phases of production. Through washing and drying, the fabric will shrink before the mask dimensions are cut on the laser cutter, and will prevent uneven shrinkage of the mask later on. Ironing the fabric ensures it’s flat and less likely to catch fire in the laser cutter and also helps speed up the process of ensuring the fabric is the right size for the laser cutter bed. Washing and ironing is an optional step, but we think it helps a lot!

Washing can be done by volunteers at home or by a professional washing service, with rates varying by location. If you’re relying on a group of volunteers to cut, wash, dry and iron, consider printing or emailing the information from this section, including the following washing and ironing tips.
